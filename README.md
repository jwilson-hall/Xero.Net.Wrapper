Key features:
- Simplified access to Xero Accounting API endpoints
- Strongly-typed models for requests and responses
- Support for modern .NET features and nullable reference types
- Designed for extensibility and maintainability

This project is ideal for developers building .NET applications that need to interact with Xero’s accounting platform.
